### Links

### My Process

1. I began the project by writing out it HTML document creating a header part, a main body part and a footer section
2. I continued by styling my header section to suit the needed design by removing link decorations and adding appropriate flexes
3. In the main body section i made two div container another programmer might have made 3 and grid them all at once but i decided to make two, flex a part and then grid one part against the order
   Note: In styling i did not forget to add necessary minmax syntax(for grid)
4. I then went to the footer section and made the necessary container and flexing them. I also add a flex-wrap so it will be more responsive
5. I built the mobile part making certain changes like changing the links above to a three bar image which when click it brings out the links this was done with javascript

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### Continued development

I will admit that in a real world project more may need to be done in a project such as this. Some of this include

1.  Links such as the Home, New, Category, Popular and Trending should have a valid page where they link to.
2.  The New section should be clickable so that it brings out news in the main section and so should the footer section
    However this projects is majorly for me to practice my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills that is why for now I have linited the scope of the Project.
